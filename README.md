### Work done
A total of seven members joined the telegram group including the three names listed above. The other four are named Confidence Eghe, Adesoji, Hamid Yusu-Esilokun and Great. But only other members apart from myself took an active role. Ajah Mundhir and Ogundele Eniola asked questions and tried to understand how the project was being done. I first of all wrote the html file before I began styling with css and made use of css flexbox. Then the screen was made responsive as best I could with screen sizes - (min-width:375px and max-width:768px) and (min-width:769px and max-width:1024px)
